          You must be at least 21 years old, or meet the minimum legal cannabis consumption age in your jurisdiction, to use the

        </ul>

        <h2>3. Content ownership</h2>
        <p>
          You retain ownership of the content you submit to GreenEdge. By posting content you grant GreenEdge a worldwide,

          developer policies. You agree not to abuse rate limits or expose private credentials. We may suspend or revoke access
          to the APIs at any time for violations of these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Disclaimers</h2>
